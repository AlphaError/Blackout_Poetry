Blackout Poetry Project

The purpose of this project is to create poetry with a posative message out of hateful things

The origin of this idea stemmed from making a series of blackout poetry pieces
transcribing famous poems from transgender poets out of JK Rowling's transphobic tweets

In the future:
-I'd love to expand this to cover a wider range of topics
-conjure more examples of blackout pieces
-create automated ways of visualizing the blackout pieces instead of just links
-format my code into a poetry piece of its own

Show every part to every stranger’s anger, surprise them with my drawers full up of maps that lead to vacancies & chart the distance from my pride, my core. Terror, do not depart but nest in the hollows of my loins & keep me on all fours. My knees, bring me to them; force my head to bow again. Replay the murders of my kin until my mind’s made new; let Adam’s bite obstruct my breath ’til I respire men & press his rib against my throat until my lips turn blue. You, O duo, O twin, whose likeness is kind: unwind my confidence & noose it round your fist so I might know you in vivid impermanence."
